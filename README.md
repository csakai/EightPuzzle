The Eight Puzzle in Python
Hi, if you're checking this out, this is a really simple implementation of the '8-puzzle' using 
AI search algorithms such as Depth-First, Breadth-First, and A* Search. As of right now, 
October 13, 2013, I have not implemented cycle checking on Depth-First Search, and as a result,
it will run wild very quickly if used.
A* search works pretty well, I am using the Manhattan Distance heuristic.
Breadth-First Search has been tested minimally.
This set of python modules was a test to see how much I have learned with Python and how well 
I can use it.
Feel free to check it out and check back for updates!
